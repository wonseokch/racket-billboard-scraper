The library provides DrRacket(Scheme) Documentation for scraping Billboard charts


While Python and R are the two most popular programming languages used to work with data, Racket also has many functionalities to perform similar tasks. We aimed to create a Racket program which can perform web scraping, a technique to extract data from web and save it as a local file. Billboard, a entertainment media company, is reputable for its music charts including Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200. These charts are updated weekly, based on radio play, sales, and online streaming. Our program allows users to access the Billboard Chart on Racket as a table and locally save it as a CSV file.
